# Phase 5 Testing: Testing and Deployment

## 1. Unit Testing
- Verify that all unit tests for backend components pass
- Test coverage should meet predetermined thresholds
- Verify that all unit tests for frontend components pass

## 2. Integration Testing
- Test end-to-end user flows (e.g., registration, chatting, viewing movie info)
- Verify that all components work together as expected
- Test error scenarios and edge cases

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline
- Verify that the CI pipeline successfully builds the project
- Test that all automated tests run in the CI environment
- Verify that the CD process successfully deploys to staging/production

## 4. Production Deployment
- Test the application in the production environment
- Verify that all features work as expected in production
- Test performance and responsiveness in the live environment

## 5. Security Testing
- Conduct penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities
- Verify that all API endpoints are properly secured
- Test for common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, etc.)

Expected Outcomes:
- All automated tests should pass in the CI environment
- Deployment to production should be smooth and error-free
- The live application should be fully functional and secure
- Performance in the production environment should meet or exceed expectations
