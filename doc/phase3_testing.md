# Phase 3 Testing: User Authentication

## 1. Firebase/Auth0 Integration
- Verify successful integration with chosen auth provider
- Test configuration and environment variables

## 2. User Registration
- Test user registration process
- Verify email verification (if applicable)
- Test error handling for invalid inputs

## 3. User Login
- Test login process with valid credentials
- Verify error handling for invalid credentials
- Test password reset functionality

## 4. Protected Routes
- Verify that protected routes are not accessible without authentication
- Test redirection to login page for unauthenticated users

## 5. Authentication Middleware
- Test that authenticated requests are processed correctly
- Verify that unauthenticated requests are rejected

Expected Outcomes:
- Users should be able to register and login successfully
- Protected routes should only be accessible to authenticated users
- JWT tokens should be properly generated and validated
